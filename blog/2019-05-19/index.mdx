At the Google I/O 2019 Firebase released it's Firebase Performance Monitoring plugin to web.
This is a easy way to find out page speed bottlenecks that are hurting the user experience.
The web version of this plugin is now in open beta.

## What does the Firebase Performance Monitoring measure?
The plugin measures [six default metrics](#default-metrics) and network traffic response time.
Users also can implement their own measurements using JavaScript.

## Implementation tutorial
In this tutorial we go through how to implement the SDK to a website.
There are many ways to implement this SDK. In this tutorial we are implementing the standalone SDK from the CDN.
Check out other ways from the [Firebase Performance Monitoring official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon/get-started-web)
### The HTML tracking snippet for Firebase Performance Monitoring
Implement snippet below as a first tag inside head.
```html
<head>
  <!-- Firebase Performance for Web -->
  <script>!function(n,e){var t,o,i,c=[],f={passive:!0,capture:!0},r=new Date,a="pointerup",u="pointercancel";function p(n,c){t||(t=c,o=n,i=new Date,w(e),s())}function s(){o>=0&&o<i-r&&(c.forEach(function(n){n(o,t)}),c=[])}function l(t){if(t.cancelable){var o=(t.timeStamp>1e12?new Date:performance.now())-t.timeStamp;"pointerdown"==t.type?function(t,o){function i(){p(t,o),r()}function c(){r()}function r(){e(a,i,f),e(u,c,f)}n(a,i,f),n(u,c,f)}(o,t):p(o,t)}}function w(n){["click","mousedown","keydown","touchstart","pointerdown"].forEach(function(e){n(e,l,f)})}w(n),self.perfMetrics=self.perfMetrics||{},self.perfMetrics.onFirstInputDelay=function(n){c.push(n),s()}}(addEventListener,removeEventListener);</script>
  <script>
    (function(sa,fbc){function load(f,c){var a=document.createElement('script');
    a.async=1;a.src=f;var s=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(a,s);}load(sa);window.onload = function() {firebase.initializeApp(fbc).performance();};
    })(
      'https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/6.0.2/firebase-performance-standalone.js',
      {
        apiKey: "{{apiKey}}",
        authDomain: "{{authDomain}}",
        databaseURL: "{{databaseURL}}",
        projectId: "{{projectId}}",
        storageBucket: "{{storageBucket}}",
        messagingSenderId: "{{messagingSenderId}}",
        appId: "{{appId}}"
      }
    );
  </script>
  <!-- End Firebase Performance for Web -->

  ...
</head>
```
Get your app's Firebase config object
```js
{
  apiKey: "{{apiKey}}",
  authDomain: "{{authDomain}}",
  databaseURL: "{{databaseURL}}",
  projectId: "{{projectId}}",
  storageBucket: "{{storageBucket}}",
  messagingSenderId: "{{messagingSenderId}}",
  appId: "{{appId}}"
}
```
from the Firebase console.

## Ready to measure
You ready to measure your site's performance. After the implementation give Firebase 12 hours to gather data.

## Default metrics
There are six default metrics that the plugin measures.

##### first paint traces
measure the time between when the user navigates to a page and when any visual change happens
##### first contentful paint traces
measure the time between when a user navigates to a page and when meaningful content displays, like an image or text
##### domInteractive traces
measure the time between when the user navigates to a page and when the page is considered interactive for the user
##### domContentLoadedEventEnd traces
measure the time between when the user navigates to a page and when the initial HTML document is completely loaded and parsed
##### loadEventEnd traces
measure the time between when the user navigates to the page and when the current document's load event completes
##### first input delay traces
measure the time between when the user interacts with a page and when the browser is able to respond to that input
